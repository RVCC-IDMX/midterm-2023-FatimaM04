    <h2>A little bit of my history:</h2>

    <p>I've been a web developer since January 18th, 2023. Languages used includes HTML, CSS, a tiny bit of Python and Java. Currently working mostly using HTML and CSS. I can help make your dream designs a reality! Whether you are wanting an art portfolio, a storefront to sell your goods, or your personal blog, I can help you achieve the final webpage you desire. Willing to work flexible schedules and complicated requests. Thanks!</p>
